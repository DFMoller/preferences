# Preferences

A collection of code examples, templates, and configuration patterns that serve as a reference for AI assistants working on my projects.

## Purpose

This repository helps AI assistants understand my preferred approaches to common development tasks by providing concrete examples of configurations, project structures, and patterns I use across different projects.

## Structure

Examples are organized by topic in separate folders (e.g., `.devcontainer/` for development container setups). Each folder may contain multiple alternative implementations - only one would typically be used in any given project.
